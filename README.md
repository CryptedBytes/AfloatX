# AfloatX
An alternative to Afloat that lives in the dock icon menu. Although AfloatX has some of the same features as Afloat, it is not meant to be a clone. AfloatX is a simple and unobtrusive plugin made to add some additional window management features.

## Current Features
  * Keep window on top (floating window)
  * Keep window on behind all other windows
  * Transient mode: Always come to focus in current space. Won't force you back to that windows last active space
  * Sticky mode: Window stays visible on all spaces
  * Invert window color
  * Click-Through window: Window is invisible to clicks (best paired with a floating window)
  * Outline Window: Outline window with 1 of 8 colors 
  * Window transparency
